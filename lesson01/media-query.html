            <h2>1 Nephi 14:7</h2>
            <p>For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a great and a marvelous work among the
                children of men; a
                work which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the otherâ€”either to the convincing of them
                unto peace and
                life eternal, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their
                minds unto
                their being brought down into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally and spiritually,
                according to the
                captivity of the devil, of which I have spoken.</p>

            <p>And they who remain shall also be quickened; nevertheless, they shall return again to their own place, to
                enjoy that
                which they are willing to receive, because they were not willing to enjoy that which they might have
                received.</p>
